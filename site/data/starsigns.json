    "definition": "The moment you come across an Aries, the first thing that comes to your mind is his/her friendly nature. People having an Aries profile cannot tolerate injustice, always fight against it and will defend the weak. The innocence of Aries people is enough to cover their, sometimes, aggressive behavior. This naivet\u00e9 brings fearlessness, while at the same time making them highly vulnerable. They trust people easily, get hurt in the process, forgive and forget, and then, trust again. An Aries person is beyond shrewdness, fallacy and lies. Aries are pretty impatient, but liberal with money and material things. Aries may get extremely angry in a minute, but the anger seldom lasts for a long time. Aries people never nurse a grudge and completely forgive and forget. They will never let you know that they are hurt. For Aries, people are either black or white, without any shades of grey. Aries usually stick to their opinion and won't listen to anything they do not believe. They have a contemplative side to their personality. The simplicity is blended with the blind passion of a born crusader. Aries is mentally strong and always one of the pioneers.",
