It's hard to get close to a Rebecca at first because they choose their friends wisely and are very untrustworthy to everyone around them. This is a good thing though because if they talk to you, they really mean everything they say and are very straightfoward about their feelings towards someone.  Rebeccas severely underestimate everything about themselves, so you need to constantly prove to them that they are much better than they think. They also can dance and sing and they will do anything they set their mind to(except driving).  It's impossible to be actually mad at a rebecca, no matter what they do, because they are so loveable :)  Rebeccas can be confusing sometimes and they can make people go crazy sometimes, but in the end, it turns out everything they do that makes you go crazy just makes you like them just that much more. They're much more than meets the eye.  Never lose doubt of Rebecca, they don't lie, they are one in a million. Just because they don't hug you doesn't mean they hate you(I hope) =)"},

{"name": "Cole", "sex": "M", "x": 1.3021023, "y": 7.708911, "definition": "Cole is the boy you never deserved and have no right to. He comes on quiet, sweet, and slow, like summer rain. He's all subtle smiles and covert glances, every flash of those caramel brown eyes kills, and the first kiss is like sweet fire. Cole has his troubles, he's misunderstood, and judged too harshly, which at times makes it appear as if he is overly judgmental of others when, in fact, you will not find a more patient listener. He is smooth-skinned and tan, always paying special attention to his appearance, especially his hair. Sometimes he comes off as superficial, but this is all a ruse. He's confusing and its easy to miss some of the signs, but when he looks at you, you'll know how he feels. His eyes express all the things he leaves unsaid. He's afraid of the word love, but if you give him the time, he'll whisper it to you. If you come across a Cole, get your shit together. He is nearly infinitely patient, and will wait for prolonged periods of time for someone he thinks is worthwhile, but if you push him away, tell him you can't care, that you don't feel the same, eventually, he'll leave. He has to, and you deserve it. The pain that ensues from being left by a Cole is nearly unbearable, and you are left to writhe in agony as you realize that it was all your fault, that he cared, that he could have loved, and you had the audacity to think he'd be there forever. If you're lucky, maybe one day he'll come back, and you know you'll never, ever let him go. Cole is perfect."}]
